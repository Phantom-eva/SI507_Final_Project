# UMICH SI 507 Final Project
### Summary

In this project, I am going to build a movie recommendation system. Based on the filter items entered by the user, such as the type of film, name, director name, rating, etc., the filtered result will be given. Then, the user can select one of the movies and the system will give a link to watch it. (possible) Provide available movie theater locations.
